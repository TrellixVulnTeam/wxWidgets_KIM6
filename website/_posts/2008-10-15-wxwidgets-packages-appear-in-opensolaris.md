wxWidgets is now available as an OpenSolaris package. It had been already
included in OpenSolaris before, as a static library which was part of the
[pgAdmin][3] package, but now the shared libraries and files required for
development using wxWidgets (SUNWwxwidgets and SUNWwxwidgets-devel packages
respectively) are included as well.
