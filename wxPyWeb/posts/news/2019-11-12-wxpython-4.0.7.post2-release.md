## "To QTKit, or not to QTKit..."

**wxPython 4.0.7.post2** is now available at 
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/wxPython/4.0.7.post2), with some additional files at
[Extras](https://extras.wxPython.org/wxPython4/extras/)

This post-release changes a wxWidgets configure option on macOS so the build
will be forced to use AVFoundation instead of QTKit. This ensures that
wxMediaCtrl will work on macOS 10.15+, where all support for QTKit has been
removed.
