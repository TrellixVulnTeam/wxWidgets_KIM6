AxTk is a new add-on for wxWidgets, for developers wishing to build self-
voiced, highly accessible applications. Text to speech is supported on Windows,
Mac and Linux/Unix, and a new menuing system gives users an easier way to
navigate an application. Adaptation of existing interfaces to speech output and
enhanced keyboard navigation is also supported. For more information, source
and samples, see the [AxTk home page][1] on Google Code.
