wxWidgets 3.1.4 release is now
[available on GitHub](https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/releases/tag/v3.1.4).
You will find there archives with the library sources and documentation as
well as binaries for the selected Windows compilers such as [Microsoft Visual
C++](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) and [MinGW-w64](https://mingw-w64.org/).

Please notice that while 3.1.4 is officially a "development" version because
it is not fully compatible with the "stable" 3.0.x, the list of backwards
incompatible changes is very short, so you shouldn't have any problems
updating to this version from 3.0.x in practice, and you're encouraged to use
this release, including in production.

### Changes in this release

In the nine months since the previous release, there have been almost 1700
commits from 74 unique contributors (37 with multiple contributions), so it is
impossible to summarize all the changes in this document without making it too
long, please see the [fuller changelog][1] for more (but still not all)
details, but some of the most important changes are:

[1]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/v3.1.4/docs/changes.txt

- wxOSX port now supports the latest macOS 11 on ARM hardware.
- wxMSW comes with a new Edge-based wxWebView implementation.
- Better, although still not perfect, per-monitor DPI support in wxMSW.
- wxGrid was has been significantly improved and is now much user friendlier.
- AUI appearance enhancements for non-default GTK themes and macOS dark mode.
- wxWidgets may now be built with C++20 compiler.
- Improvements to CMake build system.
- Allow optionally forbidding dangerous implicit wxString conversions.

And, of course, there were many, many bug fixes in all ports, notably including
fixing several long-standing problems in wxOSX.

Notice that in spite of all the changes, this release remains almost completely
compatible with 3.1.3 at the API level, so upgrading to it if you're already
using wxWidgets 3 should be straightforward.
