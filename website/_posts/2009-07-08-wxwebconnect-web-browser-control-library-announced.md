[Kirix][1] is pleased to announce the availability of wxWebConnect - a library
that enables developers to quickly integrate advanced web browser capabilities.
It wraps up functionality exposed by the Mozilla Foundation's Gecko engine
(XULRunner) into a set of user-friendly classes to: embed browser controls,
search web content, print web pages, interact with the DOM, implement custom
content handling for different MIME types, issue POST calls using the current
browser state, etc. More information can be found at the
[wxWebConnect project page][2]. A short demo video can be found [here][3].
