wxPython 2.8.6.0 has been released. Details are found
[here](http://wxpython.org/recentchanges.php), and the download page is
[here](http://wxpython.org/download.php).

An interesting thing about this release is that I made the build,
uploaded about a gig's worth of installers and packages, and everything
else that goes into making a release, all while being out of town and
away from the machines doing all the work. I was able to make all the
final tests and adjustments on my new Mac, using 
[VMware Fusion](http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/) for the Windows and
Linux specific work, and then used
[Mercurial](http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/) over an ssh tunnel
to push my changes back home to my master build and release machine. The
next part was easy, since I have been doing mostly automated builds for
a few years now. I just start it going via a ssh login and then checked
on it a few hours later from the hotel to see if it's done. At that
point things started to get a little tricky, mainly because I usually do
the rest of the release process by hand and in person. Since the full
build is about a gigabyte of binaries I transfered just a few of them to
my local machine for testing, and then I had to deal with uploading
remotely from the build machine to
[SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/wxpython/) and our 
[APT repository](http://apt.wxwidgets.org/dists/), all while I had a flaky
wireless connection here and while attending various meetings. Then I
realized that the software I usually use for editing the website is only
installed on a machine at home. Well anyway, I muddled through and
managed to get it done, and now I know where my release process could
use a bit more streamlining and automation...
