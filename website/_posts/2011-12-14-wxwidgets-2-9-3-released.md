wxWidgets 2.9.3 has been officially released. It is available from the usual
locations at [SourceForge][1] and [FTP mirror][2]. Please read the
[change log][3] if you're upgrading from a previous version. And please see
online documentation for more details.

The 2.9 series brings many improvements compared to 2.8 series such as much
better and simpler to use support for Unicode and the new wxOSX/Cocoa port,
suitable for development of 64 bit GUI applications under OS X, as well as a
huge number of other new features and bug fixes. Compared to the previous 2.9.2
release, the most important change in this release is the integration of the
new [wxWebView][4] library. Other additions include [wxTreeListCtrl][5],
[wxTimePickerCtrl][6], [wxRichToolTip][7] and [wxBannerWindow][8] as well as
many incremental improvements and bug fixes to the existing classes.

While this is still officially a development release because some API details
are still not frozen, we believe that 2.9.3 can be used in production
environment, especially for the new projects for which (small) changes in
behaviour since 2.8 are not a problem. Give it a try and let us know what do
you think!
