A number of people have asked me about it and so I finally decided that
it is high time that I give the whole [twitter](http://twitter.com)
thing a try.  Of course I've gotten into it late enough that my usual
user name, [RobinD](http://twitter.com/RobinD) is already taken,
although that page returns an error.  (I suspect that somebody got their
account suspended...)  Strangely enough somebody has already registered
the [wxPython](http://twitter.com/wxPython) name, although they haven't
tweeted anything since last July...  Anyway, if you'd like to follow me
or send me messages on twitter I am known there as
[RobinD42](http://twitter.com/RobinD42). Bear with me while I take my
first steps in this new environment...
