If you haven't read it recently, please start by reading at least the 
`Submitting Bugs <http://www.contribution-guide.org/#submitting-bugs>`_
section of the 
`Contributing to Open Source Projects <http://www.contribution-guide.org/>`_
document. Building upon that foundation, please follow these steps when
submitting your bug report to the wxPython Phoenix project.

1. Do your due dilligence and **search** for any previous reports or other
   information about the bug you've discovered, not just the GitHub issues
   but Google for it too. You may find that it is already known, perhaps that
   there is a workaround for it, or even that it is intended behavior and is
   not a bug.

2. If you're not on the **latest version** of wxPython, get it and try to
   duplicate your bug there. It may have already been fixed.

3. If you still want to report the issue then go to the 
   `issues page <https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues>`_ for the wxPython 
   Phoenix project and click the New Issue button.

4. **Include the following** items in your description of the issue

   a. Opperating System
   b. wxPython version
   c. Python version
   d. If your wxPython binaries did not come from PyPI, where did you get it? Did you build it yourself?
   e. Steps needed to reproduce the issue
   f. A `small runnable sample <https://wiki.wxpython.org/MakingSampleApps>`_ application that can be used to reproduce the issue, see also `SSCCE <http://sscce.org/>`_ and `MCVE <https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve>`_.
