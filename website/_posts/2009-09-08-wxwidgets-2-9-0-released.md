We are pleased to announce the first release in the 2.9 development series.
wxWidgets 2.9.0 gives a flavour of what will be provided in the stable
wxWidgets 3.0 version next year, and we are interested in your feedback.
Enhancements in 2.9 include the removal of the distinction between ANSI and
Unicode builds, and a reworked Mac OS X architecture, supporting both 32-bit
Carbon and 32-bit/64-bit Cocoa variants (wxOSX/Cocoa at alpha stage). You can
get wxWidgets 2.9.0 from the [download page][1].
