People who are familiar with wxPython and wxWidgets, and who are willing to
help answer questions, can often be found in the #wxpython and #wxwidgets
IRC channels at [freenode.net](http://freenode.net).  If you are not
already familiar with IRC or have no clue how to get connected, what client
software to use, or whatever then you'll find a simple web-based IRC client
in the box below.  Simply choose a nickname, prove you are a human by
solving the reCAPTCHA, and click connect.  The stuff you type in the text
field at the bottom will then be relayed to all other users presently in
the channel.

You can learn more about IRC at [IRC Help](http://www.irchelp.org/).  You
may also want to read [this](http://wiki.wxwidgets.org/IRC).  If you expect
to be using IRC more than just once or twice then registering your nickname
is a good idea.  See the [Freenode FAQ](http://freenode.net/faq.shtml) for
details.

The same rules apply to IRC channels as for [mail lists](/pages/maillists),
namely: be polite, be patient, be helpful, be kind, and avoid the 3 W's: no
whining, no whinging and don't be a weenie.  In other words, do not type
anything that your granny might smack you for if she saw you do it.
