## "Applesauce"

**wxPython 4.0.6** is now available at 
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/wxPython/4.0.6), with some additional files at
[Extras](https://extras.wxPython.org/wxPython4/extras/)

This is a quick-fix release to take care of the following issues:

* Fixed a probably rare, but fatal bug on OSX when calling certain 
  overloaded virtual methods with implementations in Python.

* Fixed char pointers in generated stub code to have a valid pointer value.

* Reverted the change that loads up install_requires from the contents of
  requirements.txt. Split the requirements.txt file into one for install and one
  for development.
