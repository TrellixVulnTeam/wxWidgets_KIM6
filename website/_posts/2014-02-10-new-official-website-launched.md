We're proud to announce a fresh new look for the official wxWidgets website for
the first time in nearly 8 years!

Some of the highlights include:

* Responsive design making the website available to mobile devices.
* Utilizes [Bootstrap][] for easy skinning.
* Now built on [Jekyll][] replacing PyMeld.
* Allows for comments on news posts (let us know what you think!)
* Most content is authored in [Markdown][] format.
* Updates to the site can now be submitted to the [GitHub repo][git]

We've refreshed and reorganized content on many pages throughout the entire
website, so be sure to really explore.

For those familiar with Bootstrap, you might notice that we're still using the
default styles. If you know a talented web designer, we'd still love to see
some new styles that would really make the site unique. We're even managing all
site styles using [LESS][]. We're pretty pleased with how much better it looks
already though (and obviously enough to launch the new website as-is).
