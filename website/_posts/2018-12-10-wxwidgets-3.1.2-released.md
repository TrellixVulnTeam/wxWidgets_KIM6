wxWidgets 3.1.2 release is now
[available on GitHub](https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/releases/tag/v3.1.2).
You will find there archives with the library sources and documentation as
well as binaries for the selected Windows compilers such as Microsoft Visual
C++, [MinGW-TDM](http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net/) and
[MinGW-w64](https://mingw-w64.org/).

Please notice that while 3.1.2 is officially a "development" version because
it is not fully compatible with the "stable" 3.0.x, the list of backwards
incompatible changes is very short, so you shouldn't have any problems
updating to this version from 3.0.x in practice, and you're encouraged to use
this release, including in production.

### Changes in this release

There have been more than 1200 commits from 75 contributors (41 with multiple
contributions) since 3.1.1, which makes it difficult to summarize them in this
short post. The primary focus of this release is on bug fixes (closing more
than 100 bugs from wxTrac) and incremental improvements in preparation for the
next stable 3.2.0 release, however there is a usual lot of new features as
well, including:

- Initial support for macOS 10.14 and its dark mode.
- Support for non-integer font sizes and arbitrary font weights.
- New wxLZMA{Input,Output}Stream classes.
- Add wxDataViewToggleRenderer::ShowAsRadio(), wxDisplay::GetPPI(),
  wxGrid::SetCornerLabelValue(), wxHtmlEasyPrinting::SetPromptMode(),
  wxJoystickEvent::GetButtonOrdinal(), wxToolbook::EnablePage().

Some of the other improvements:

- There were again many improvements to the (still experimental) wxQt port.
- Fix several bugs related to focus handling and TAB navigation in wxGTK.
- Make it possible to control pagination in wxHTML more precisely.
- Fix several problems with high-DPI displays.
- wxOSX now uses native NSImage/UIImage representation for wxBitmap.
- Support strike-through font attribute in XRC and wxDataViewCtrl markup too.
- Support more than 4 buttons in wxJoystick.
- Add wxwidgets.props property sheet file for MSVS users.
