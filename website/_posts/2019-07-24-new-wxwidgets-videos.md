Two new wxWidgets video tutorials have been recently published by
[Javidx9](https://onelonecoder.com/) on YouTube: here is the [first
part](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOIbK4bJKS8), introducing programming
with wxWidgets in C++ and the here is the [second
one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwUGeV2fnfM), showing how to develop a
simple application.

If you have always wanted to learn programming wxWidgets but were intimidated
by the size of [its manual](https://docs.wxwidgets.org/trunk/index.html), you
may appreciate this alternative way of getting acquainted with it.

Thanks to Javidx9 for producing the videos!
