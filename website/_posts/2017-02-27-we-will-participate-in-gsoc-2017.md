After a two year hiatus, wxWidgets is participating in Google Summer of Code
(GSoC) program again! GSoC is a great program allowing students to do
something useful to many people and gain experience and learn new things
during the summer and be paid a stipend for doing it. As for the open source
projects, such as wxWidgets, it's a great opportunity to attract more
developers to the projects.

Please see the [program site](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/)
to learn more about it and, most importantly, please spread the word among any
students or professors you know -- we are looking for motivated students who
would be interested in working on wxWidgets during the summer. Thanks in
advance!
