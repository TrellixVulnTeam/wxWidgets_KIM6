**wxPython 2.9.2.2** has been released.  This build adds some fixes for some 
annoying and subtle bugs, and also a couple nice new features.  The Cairo version 
of the wx.GraphicsContext back-end can now be used on Windows, and there is a new 
module in the library that helps wx applications to update themselves when new 
versions of the software are released.
