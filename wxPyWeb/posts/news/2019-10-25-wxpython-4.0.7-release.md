## "one more, for the road"

**wxPython 4.0.7** is now available at 
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/wxPython/4.0.7), with some additional files at
[Extras](https://extras.wxPython.org/wxPython4/extras/)

This release is comprised mostly of fixes and minor features which have been
back-ported from the master branch. This release is likely the last release of
the 4.0.x release series, and is certainly the last 4.0.x release that will
support Python 2.7. It may still continue to build for Python 2.7 for some time, 
but no extra effort will be expended to keep it compatible.

This release provides the following changes:

* Bug fixes in wx.lib.calendar: key navigation across month boundaries is now 
  possible; key navigation now sets the date and fires the EVT_CALENDAR event; 
  setter APIs now set the date correctly 
  [#1230](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/1230).

* Switch to using a wx.Overlay in the Widget Inspection Tool to highlight
  widgets when running on a GTK3 port.

* Fixed issue in wx.lib.agw.customtreectrl where label editor could remain
  stuck forever 
  [#1235](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/1235).

* Fix a sometimes crash when using a wx.Overlay by letting the wx.DCOverlay hold
  a reference to the DC, to ensure that the DCOverlay is destroyed first.
  [PR#1301](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/pull/1301)
  
* Ported the embedding sample from Classic, which shows how to use wxPython from
  a C++ wxWidgets application that embeds Python. 
  [PR#1353](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/pull/1353)

* Fixed wx.GetApp() to use wxWidgets' global wxApp instance instead of 
  maintaining its own pointer. This way, if the wxApp is created by C++ code
  wxPython will still be able to get access to it. 
  [#1126](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/1126)
  
* Several other PRs have been backported from the master branch (which will 
  become wxPython 4.1.0), the full list can be seen on GitHub 
  [here](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/pull/1357).
