I found out last week at the [OSCON](http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2008/)
conference that my software is being used at the South Pole by the
[IceCube Neutrino Observatory](http://icecube.wisc.edu/) project
currently being constructed about a kilometer from the Pole.  They are
using [wxPython](http://wxPython.org/) for the controller user interface
of the [machine](http://gallery.icecube.wisc.edu/external/3-build-ehwd/)
that is drilling holes 2.4 kilometers down into the ice.  There isn't
anything on their website about that piece of software, but it's real
interesting anyway ;-) 
[Here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SskyDuTfH0o) is a bit more about
the drill.  There are also these
[pictures](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ksbeattie/sets/72157594267166135/),
[videos](http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=51EF4CAB8762D855) and
[blog](http://ksblog.wordpress.com/) from one of the scientists that
gave the presentation I attended where he shows a bit about what life at
the Pole is like.  (Where a nice warm summer's day might get up to -31F.
Brr!!)

This news means that I now have reports of wxPython being used from
every continent on this planet. Yay!
