The wxWidgets project has been accepted for participation in
[Google Summer of Code 2014][1] program which allows students to work on open
source projects during the summer and be paid for it. We propose a number of
[project ideas][2] this summer but are also open to other suggestions, please
see our [GSoC page][3] for more information about this program.

This is a great opportunity both for the students and wxWidgets and we hope to
see many applications this year. Please help to spread the word and encourage
any motivated students you know to apply (or apply yourself if you can, of
course)!
