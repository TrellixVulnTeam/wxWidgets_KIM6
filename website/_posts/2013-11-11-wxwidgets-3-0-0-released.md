The final version of wxWidgets 3.0, the first new stable wxWidgets release in
years and the first new major release since 1998, is now available. Please
download the [sources][1] and [binaries][2] for the selected Windows compilers
(Microsoft Visual C++ and [MinGW-TDM][3]) from SourceForge or our
[FTP mirror][4]. As usual, the release files contain the sources and the
documentation for the library in Unix (.tar.bz2) and Windows (.zip or .7z, with
the latter being significantly smaller) formats. Notice that the documentation
is also [available online][5].

3.0 release is a culmination of several years of work since 2.8 and so brings
many important improvements compared to the old stable series, such as more
transparent support for Unicode that's easier to use, the new wxOSX/Cocoa port,
suitable for development of 64 bit GUI applications under OS X, and support for
GTK+ 3 in wxGTK port, as well as a huge number of other new features and bug
fixes which are too numerous to be listed here, so please refer to the
[change log][6] for the full list. And if you're upgrading from a previous
version, please pay special attention to the "incompatible changes" section of
this file and the [changes chapter][7] of the manual for even more details.

We hope you will enjoy using the latest and greatest version of wxWidgets! And
if not, there is always the possibility to [report bugs][8] in it on our bug
tracker. Have fun and good luck!
