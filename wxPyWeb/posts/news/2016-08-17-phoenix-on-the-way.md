The **wxPython Phoenix** train is back on the tracks and moving forward at
full steam ahead!

"*Phoenix*" is the code name of the next generation of the wxPython project. 
The primary goals of the project are to make it much easier&mdash;through
increased automation&mdash;to develop, maintain, and enhance wxPython in the
future, and to remove old hacks and other cruft that are no longer needed and
which tends to cause confusion for new users. The secondary goals are to make
wxPython *"...better, stronger, faster."* than he was before.

While Phoenix is currently in a pre-alpha state, it is already in a very
usable state and many people are already using it in their projects.  You can
download binary wheels for Python 2.7, 3.4 and 3.5 on Windows and OSX from the
[snapshots folder](https://wxpython.org/Phoenix/snapshot-builds/).
Be sure to check the 
[README](https://wxpython.org/Phoenix/snapshot-builds/README.txt) file
there for more details about what is there and how to use it.  Alpha #1 is on
the horizon, at which point Phoenix will start being available directly from
PyPI.

If you want to learn more about Phoenix or to help with the effort, please
join the 
[wxPython-dev group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/wxpython-dev).  You can also
track development or submit PRs at the 
[Phoenix GitHub project](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix).

Finally, members of the wxPython community have joined together to make
pledges towards a bounty reward for the completion of the Phoenix release,
with the primary goal of jump-starting development.  If you are interested in
making a pledge, please read this 
[message thread](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/wxpython-users/-ey4AysT9ao/UYTh4TuSBQAJ) 
and contact David Hughes. No actual money will be requested or transferred until the 
release is completed.
