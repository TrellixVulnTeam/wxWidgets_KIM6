While browsing around on the [Packt
Publishing](http://www.packtpub.com/) web site after looking at the page
for Cody's book I saw that there are currently a couple promotional
deals that may interest some of you. There is the [Python
Month](http://www.packtpub.com/article/exclusive-offer-on-python-books)
deal that will give you 20% off any Python book they publish, or 30% off
of any Python eBook. Â The other deal is that you can currently get any 5
eBooks from Packt for \$40.
