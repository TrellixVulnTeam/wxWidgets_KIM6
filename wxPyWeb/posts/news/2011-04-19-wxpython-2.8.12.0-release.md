This is pretty much a bug-fix only release, although some of the 3rd
party modules in wx.lib have also been updated and include some new
features.  You can download it from the wxPython [download
page](http://wxpython.org/download.php).  As always you should join the
[wxPython-users group](http://groups.google.com/group/wxpython-users)
hosted at GoogleGroups for questions, support, comments, or just for the
sake of being part of an awesome community.
