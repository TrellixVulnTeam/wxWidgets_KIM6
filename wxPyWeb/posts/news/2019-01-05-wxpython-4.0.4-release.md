## "What? It's 2019 already?"

**wxPython 4.0.4** is now available at 
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/wxPython/4.0.4), with some additional files at
[Extras](https://extras.wxPython.org/wxPython4/extras/)


Changes in this release include the following:

<!-- TEASER_END -->

* Fixed an issue where wx.lib.intctrl would erroneously attempt to use long
  on Python3. ([#898](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/898))

* Include the MSVC runtime DLLs for Python 3.7 builds too.

* Clear LIBPATH_PYEXT and LIB_PYEXT for linux builds too. ([#904](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/904))

* Added a dependency on the Pillow package since it's used in some wx.lib.agw
  modules. ([PR#908](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/pull/908))

* Add flag to hide page in wx.lib.agw.aui.notebook. ([#895](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/895))

* Switch wx.lib.plot to issue deprecation warnings with PlotPendingDeprecation
  so it doesn't have to enable all warnings to get them to be shown by default.
  ([#902](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/902))

* Added a Python 3.7 builder on Fedora 28. ([#925](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/925))

* Fix the object ownership transfer for wx.Menu.Insert() ([#931](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/931))

* Added wx.Treebook.GetTreeCtrl, wx.Listbook.GetListView and
  wx.Choicebook.GetChoiceCtrl. ([#918](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/918))

* Removed the wx.BookCtrlBase.RemovePage workaround as it was causing problems
  and doesn't seem to be necessary any more. The existing wxWidgets assertions
  are catching the out of range error just fine, however if wxWidgets was built
  without the debug helpers turned on then it could still cause a crash. ([#888](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/888))

* Reverted the changes which removed the content of the wx.lib.pubsub package
  and encouraged users to switch to the real PyPubSub package instead. Removing
  it caused more issues than were expected so it has been restored and the code
  updated to PyPubSub v3.3.0. Version 4.0.0 is available upstream, but it is not
  compatible with Python 2.7. Now, wx.lib.pubsub is actually deprecated instead
  of just trying to pass control over to the upstream PyPubSub library. ([#932](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/932))

* Improve calltip stability in pyshell. ([#941](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/941))

* Fix TypeError in wx.lib.throbber. ([#924](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/924))

* Fix missing parameter tool_id in
  wx.lib.agw.ribbon.toolbar.RibbonToolBar.AddToggleTool. ([#947](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/947))

* Add a step to wx.Config.ReadInt to attempt converting from long to int
  under python2. ([#384](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/384))

* Add virtual behavior for wx.RichTextCtrl and wx.TextCtrl's Copy/Cut/Paste methods
  and their Can* counterparts. ([#954](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/954))

* Fix IO type in wx.lib.agw.thumbnailctrl  ([#959](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/959))

* Fix type error that would occur using pycolourchooser. ([#957](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/957))

* Optimize line drawing in HyperTreeList. ([#973](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/973))

* Add wrapper for wx.StaticBox.GetBordersForSizer and use it in the demo to do
  platform-specific layout of the items in the StaticBox. ([#974](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/974))

* Update wx.Point, wx.RealPoint, and wx.Size to use floating
  point arithmetic when conducting scalar multiplication ([#971](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/971))

* Fix load/save bugs in PySlices ([PR#978](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/pull/978))

* Replace deprecated PIL.Image.tostring ([PR#1005](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/pull/1005))

* Fix rendering and mouse sensitivity in UltimateListCtrl when adding HyperText
  items. ([#1010](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/1010))

* Added a parameter to lib.agw.CustomTreeCtrl.SetItemWindow(), to allow
  positioning the Window (a small image) on the left of text in a
  CustomTreeItem. ([#PR886](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/pull/886)).

* Declared DeleteAllPages in the notebook subclasses, so the proper C++
  implementation will be called. ([#972](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/972))

* Removed wx.lib.floatbar, which has been deprecated forever and probably
  hasn't been working in nearly as long. ([#976](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/976))

* Updated SIP to version 4.19.13.

* Fix an issue in wx.lib.agw.aui.AuiManager where the orientation of
  an AuiToolBar would not be updated when calling LoadPerspective. ([#917](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/917))

* Fixed a bug in wx.FileSystemHandler.OpenFile where the object ownership was
  not being transferred correctly, causing a crash after a premature object
  deletion. ([#926](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/926))

* Fixed wx.ListCtrl.Append when wx.LC_SORT style is used, so appending items out
  of order does not lose the data for the remaining columns. ([#906](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/906))

* Add wx.Accessible, it's Windows-only, will raise a NotImplementedError
  exception on the other platforms. ([#958](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/958))

* Added the ability to generate stub classes for use when optional wxWidgets
  features are not part of the build. So far, stubs are available for
  wx.Accessible, wx.FileSystemWatcher, wx.glcanvas, wx.media and wx.html2.

* Moved the wxpy_api.h file into the wx package at wx/include/wxPython so it
  will be included in the wheel file. ([#961](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/961))

* Fixed how string data is added to a virtual file-like object in
  wx.MemoryFSHandler. All strings are now added to the file as utf-8 encoded data,
  in both Python2 and Python3, and will be read from the virtual file the same
  way. If you need to use some other encoding for some reason you can first
  convert the text to a bytesarray or other buffer protocol compatible object and
  then create the virtual file from that data. ([#969](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/969))

* Performance update for wx.lib.agw.customtreectrl ([#1049](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/1049))

* Ensure that colours set in wx.lib.agw.customtreectrl.TreeItemAttr are
  instances of wx.Colour. ([#1032](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/1032))

* Fix drawing of ticks in wx.lib.agw.speedmeter when there are negative bounds
  values. ([#1013](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/1013))

* wxWidgets for Mac includes the wxJoystick class now, also update the demo.
  ([#997](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/997))

* Fix wx.html.HtmlPrintout to not be seen as an abstract class, so it can be
  instantiated. ([#1060](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/1060))

* Fix wx.aui.AuiNotbook.SetArtProvider to properly transfer ownership of the art
  object from Python to C++. This possible double-deletion and related crashing
  problems. ([#1061](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/1061))

* Fixed the wrappers for wx.html.HtmlWindow.OnOpeningURL to properly handle the
  redirect output parameter. ([#1068](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/1068)) This is a backwards-incompatible change,
  please see the Migration Guide for details.

* TabNavigatorWindow works similarly to other programs now. It's resizable and
  draggable so if user has tons of files with long names, it isn't an irritation
  anymore plastered right in the middle of the screen and can't be worked with
  easily and ESC now cancels the popup with a proper returnId. ([#1096](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/1096))

* Added missing methods in wx.ListBox, SetItemForegroundColour,
  SetItemBackgroundColour and SetItemFont. ([#1095](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/1095))

* Backported a fix in wxWidgets that avoids crashing in hhctrl.ocx when using
  context sensitive help in 64-bit builds on Windows. ([#1104](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/1104))
