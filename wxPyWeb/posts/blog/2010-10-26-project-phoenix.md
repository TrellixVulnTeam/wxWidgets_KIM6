For a couple years now myself and a few others have been hinting that a
totally new way to develop wxPython is possible and is just over the
horizon.  I'm happy to announce that the project is finally moving
beyond the pie-in-the-sky stage and that development of the tools has
begun.  More details are available in the [wxPython
wiki](http://wiki.wxpython.org/ProjectPhoenix), and you can join the
discussion about the project in the
[wxPython-dev](http://groups.google.com/group/wxPython-dev) mail list.
