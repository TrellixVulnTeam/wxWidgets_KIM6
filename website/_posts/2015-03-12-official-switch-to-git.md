wxWidgets is now officially [on GitHub](https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets)!

While we were using this repository since quite some time before, it was only
a mirror of the main, Subversion, repository hosted elsewhere. But we have
finally left Subversion behind and are now using Git exclusively. Most of the
documentation has been updated to reflect the switch, but please let us know
if we forgot something and there are still mentions of svn anywhere.

This should make getting the latest wxWidgets sources and participating in its
development even simpler than before. We still continue to use [our own
bug tracker](https://trac.wxwidgets.org/), but you can also submit pull
requests on GitHub, if only to test your changes with [Travis
CI](https://travis-ci.org/wxWidgets/wxWidgets).
