### "Lemonade"

**wxPython 4.0.1** is now available at 
[PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/wxPython/4.0.1), with some 
additional files at the 
[Extras archive](https://extras.wxPython.org/wxPython4/extras/).

This release is a quick hot-fix of some issues discovered in 4.0.0 just after
the release, plus a bit of  low-hanging fruit that was easy to squeeze in too.
Changes in this release include the following:

<!-- TEASER_END -->

* A fix for a segfault that happens upon startup on newer linux releases. 
  ([#648](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/648))

* Set LD_RUN_PATH for the wxWidgets part of the build so the wx libs that are
  loaded by other wx libs can be found successfully. 
  ([#723](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/723))

* Use wxApp::GetInstance to check if there is an existing wxApp object. 
  ([#720](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/720))
