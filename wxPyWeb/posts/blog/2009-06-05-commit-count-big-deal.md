[This
announcement](http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=960188)
from the PLplot project, and this
[report](http://tech.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=09/06/05/0231200) about
it from Slashdot tout the ten thousandth commit to PLplot's source
repository.  My response?  "Big deal!"  Both the Python and wxWidgets
projects are about the same age as PLplot and the wx repository
currently has almost 61,000 commits, and the Python repository has over
73,000 commits.  While those numbers are impressive considering that
they represent mostly volunteer unpaid time from dozens of developers,
they still pale compared to other projects.

On the other hand, the number of commits is really a very poor metric to
measure open source projects by.  Much more  impressive is the number of
users who would rather be using the software than anything else that
could compete with it.
