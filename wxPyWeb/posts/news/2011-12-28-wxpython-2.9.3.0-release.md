**wxPython (classic) 2.9.3.0** has been released.  Among other things, this 
build adds some classes produced by one of the Google Summer of Code
projects,  wx.html2.WebView and related classes.  This gives wxPython the
ability to embed a native HTML/CSS/JS renderer using the same API and
events on all platforms.
