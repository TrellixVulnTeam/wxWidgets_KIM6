A few years ago I realized that this whole "blogging thing" wasn't just
a passing fad, and decided that maybe I should jump on the bandwagon and
do a bit of blogging myself. After all, within certain communities I'm a
fairly well known Internet personality, the de-facto leader of one of
those communities, and involved in several others to varying levels. So
why shouldn't I blog?

Fast-forward three years... Looking back I see a series of Life Eventsâ„¢,
tons of work, and plenty of excuses that have gotten in the way to
actually moving forward with this project. However a few days ago a
family member asked me to set up a blog for them on my site, and I
decided that I couldn't make excuses to myself any longer and that it is
past time that I do one for myself. So I set this up at the same time as
the other blog and here it is. Now I have a place to write about 
[Life, the Universe, and Everything](/pages/about-42/), and
anything else that tickles my fancy from time to time. Hopefully you'll
enjoy reading as much as I hope to enjoy writing it.
