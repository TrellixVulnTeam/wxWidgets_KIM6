The
wxPython community now has a 2nd book about our favorite UI toolkit. The
book is "[wxPython 2.8 Application Development
Cookbook](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1849511780?ie=UTF8&tag=wxpython-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1849511780)"
written by Cody Precord and published by [Packt
Publishing](https://www.packtpub.com/wxpython-2-8-application-development-cookbook/book%20).
Cody is the creator of the awesome [Editra](http://editra.org/) source
code editor and a frequent participant on the
[wxPython-users](http://groups.google.com/group/wxpython-users) mail
list. There is an
[eBook](https://www.packtpub.com/wxpython-2-8-application-development-cookbook/book)
version of the text available from Packt Publishing, and you can get the
printed version from Packt or from other booksellers such as
[amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1849511780?ie=UTF8&tag=wxpython-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1849511780).

I haven't read all the recipes yet, but from what I've seen so far I can
say that they are informative and do a good job of explaining the
demonstrated techniques and the concepts used or implemented in the
sample source code. Â I think that there will be something for everyone
in this book, from newbies all the way up to experienced users.

Congrats Cody!
