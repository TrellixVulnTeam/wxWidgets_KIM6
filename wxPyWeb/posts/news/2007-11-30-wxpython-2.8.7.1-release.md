I've just released the new **2.8.7.1** build of **wxPython**. This
release has had some bugs fixed, some minor patches applied, and also
incorporates the Google Summer of Code 2007 version of XRCed, and adds
the Editra source code editor. More details can be found in the [changes
list](http://wxpython.org/recentchanges.php). wxPython source and
binaries for Windows, Mac OS X and Fedora can be downloaded from the
[download page](http://wxpython.org/download.php). Binaries for Debian
and Ubuntu i386 and amd64 architectures are available in the [wxWidgets
APT repository](http://apt.wxwidgets.org/dists/), see this [wiki
page](http://wiki.wxpython.org/InstallingOnUbuntuOrDebian) for details.

**NOTE**: On Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard) the Python 2.5 binaries of wxPython
expect to be used with the user-installed version of
[MacPython](http://python.org/download/), ***not*** the Apple installed
version. A fix for this issue is being worked on for the next release.
In the meantime you can either install MacPython 2.5.1 and adjust your
paths so that that Python is used, or you can stick with Apple's Python
and the wxPython 2.8.4.0 that comes with Leopard.

Happy Hacking!
