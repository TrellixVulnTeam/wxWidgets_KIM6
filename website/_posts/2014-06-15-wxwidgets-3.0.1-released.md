wxWidgets 3.0.1 bug fix release is now [available][1]. Upgrading to it is
strongly recommended for all users of 3.0.0 as it contains more than a hundred
of important bug fixes to all ports but remains 100% compatible with 3.0.0,
both at the API and the ABI level, and so upgrading to it doesn't require
absolutely any changes to the existing applications.

In addition to the fixes, described in more details in the [change log][6],
this release also includes project files for Microsoft Visual C++ 2012 and
2013 users.

As usual, please download the [sources][1] or [binaries][2] if you are using
one of the supported Windows compilers (Microsoft Visual C++ or [MinGW-TDM][3])
from SourceForge or our [FTP mirror][4]. The documentation can be downloaded
for the offline use from the same locations or [consulted online][5].

Thanks to everybody who contributed, by reporting bugs and submitting patches,
to this wxWidgets release. We hope you will find it even better than the
previous one and will enjoy using it!
