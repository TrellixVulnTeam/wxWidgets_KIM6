The recently released [Google Drive][1] system desktop client
[uses wxPython][2]. Considering that [Dropbox][3] desktop client is also
written in wxPython it could be taken as a proof that wxWidgets provides a
solid foundation for cloud-based systems!

And as Google Drive application uses wxWidgets 2.9.3, it should hopefully help
answering the often-asked question if 2.9 series is good enough for production
use.
