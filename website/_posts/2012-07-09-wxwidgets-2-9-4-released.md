wxWidgets 2.9.4 has been officially released. It is available right now from
[SourceForge][1]. Notice that for the first time we experimentally make
available not only the sources for this release, but also the [binaries][2] for
Microsoft Visual C++ users.

Please read [the change log][3] if you're upgrading from a previous version.
And please see [online documentation][4] for more details.

The 2.9 series bring many improvements compared to 2.8 series such as much
better and simpler to use support for Unicode and the new wxOSX/Cocoa port,
suitable for development of 64 bit GUI applications under OS X, as well as a
huge number of other new features and bug fixes. Compared to the previous 2.9.3
release, the most important change in this release is beta-level support for
GTK+ 3 in wxGTK port. Mostly, the focus of this release is, however, on bug
fixes in preparation for 3.0. In particular, a lot of improvements have been
done in wxOSX/Cocoa port.

While this is still officially a development release because some API details
are still not frozen, we believe that 2.9.4 can be used in production
environment, especially for the new projects for which (small) changes in
behaviour since 2.8 are not a problem. Give it a try and let us know what do
you think!
