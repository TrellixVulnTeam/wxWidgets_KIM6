Yeah, I know what you're thinking... That headline sounds like something
you might read while standing in the checkout line at the supermarket
next to photos of aliens from the future rescuing some baby porkers from
the path of a Vogon engineered tornado headed for the next trailer park
on their list of sites to demolish to make room for a new highway. Well
if that's what you're thinking (come on, admit it, you *know* you were)
then you're wrong. Keep reading for some info about another kind of Time
Machine, and another kind of Bacon.

<!-- TEASER_END -->

## A brief history of Time Machines

First on the list, of course, is [*The Time
Machine*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Time_Machine) by one of the
fathers of Science Fiction himself, H. G. Wells, written in 1895. I
suspect that there must have been a few nuggets of truth in this
fictional work. How else could he know that the basic themes of his work
would continue to appeal to the masses more than a century after he
created it? What about the many science fictional technologies that have
become science facts over the years? Perhaps this same trans 4th
dimensional tool was shared with Jules Verne when he wrote about the
world-wide communications network that would be created in the 20th
century... I expect that it was then passed on to other Sci-Fi greats
down through the generations like Asimov, Heinlein, Bradburry, and
others...

Next, because it had an impact on my life that I still remember, I
should mention the 1960 movie adaptation of [*The Time
Machine*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Time_Machine_%281960_film%29).
I remember my Grandfather taking me to this movie when I was but a wee
lad sometime in the mid 1970's. I remember having to walk the 10 or 12
city blocks from where we parked to where the "surprise" was located. I
thought the surprise was going to be ice cream or something and started
complaining (loudly) when we passed a perfectly good ice cream shop
along the way. I say "walk" but it was more like "run" because my short
little boy legs had to keep up with my Grandpa's long, quick strides.
Grandpa's favorite form of exercise was walking, (which is why he parked
so far away) and if you couldn't keep up you got left in the dust. When
we finally got to the surprise, I actually was surprised that it was a
movie instead of ice cream, but disappointed that it wasn't a "kids
movie" and probably did a bit more complaining at this point. I'm
telling you all this about the trip to the theater to help you see the
contrast of the trip back. After emerging from the theater a couple
hours later my mind was filled with wonder and excitement, and my
imagination was running wild and in top gear. I must have floated all
the way back to the car because I don't remember a single step of it, or
maybe I time traveled and just skipped ahead 30 minutes. In either case,
from that day forward I was a definite Sci-Fi fan.

Next stop on our mini time machine tour is Doc Brown's stainless steel
De Lorian with its Flux Capacitor in [*Back to the
Future*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_to_the_Future)*.* What kid in
the '80s (or half the adults for that matter) didn't dream of *being*
Marty McFly and of the adventures that would be possible with access to
a time machine?

Also on the list are Captains Kirk, Picard, Janeway and Archer who often
seemed to be dealing with cleaning up one mess or another related to
paradoxes spawned from fooling around with the space-time continuum.
(You may notice that a name is missing from that list, but personally I
don't consider DS9 to be part of the Star Trek family. It's like the
Sesame Street game "Which of these things is not like the others?")

The next time machine that I have personal experience with is [Guido's
Time Machine](http://catb.org/esr/jargon/html/G/Guido.html) which is a
well known phenomenon in the [Python](http://python.org/) developer
community. Here's how it works: In the early days of Python development
some Joe Programmer pines for Python FizzlePops in the newsgroup saying
something like "FizzlePops are a cool new thing in the furglebergle
language. Wouldn't it be great if Python could do that?" Quite often
there would be a response five minutes later from Guido saying something
like "That's a great idea. I implemented it last week." After it became
common knowledge that Guido owns a time machine we can often find
references to it being used over much greater lengths of time, for
example when a newly requested feature suddenly appears in prior
releases of the software, even in releases as much as a few years old!
PJE [describes](http://dirtsimple.org/2004/12/python-is-not-java.html)it
this way:

> Pretend that Python is a magic wand that will miraculously do whatever
> you want without you needing to lifting a finger. Ask, "how does
> Python already solve my problem?" and "What Python language feature
> most resembles my problem?" You will be absolutely astonished at how
> often it happens that thing you need is already there in some form. In
> fact, this phenomenon is so common, even among experienced Python
> programmers, that the Python community has a name for it. We call it
> "Guido's time machine", because sometimes it seems as though that's
> the only way he could've known what we needed, before we knew it
> ourselves.

I've had the opportunity now and then to borrow Guido's time machine in
my work on [wxPython](http://wxPython.org/) and I have to admit that it
is an utterly exhilarating experience! The wxPython users really
appreciate it too, and it is the little things like time travel that can
really help to build a loyal community around a software development
tool and build strength for the future.

## What about saving the bacon?

So, if you're still reading along at this point and haven't wandered off
into the space-time continuum yourself, you're probably wondering what
all this has to do with saving
[bacon](/images/2008/06/bacon.wav "bacon.wav")...
Well the time machine that is affecting my life today is [Apple's Time
Machine](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/timemachine.html) and the
bacon in question is mine. Here's the story: Several days ago the
Software Update tool popped up telling me that there is an update to OS
X 10.5.3 available. Since I was in the middle of work and I knew that
this update would require a reboot I decided that I would deal with it
later and just hid the update window and went back to work, where I
promptly forgot about the update notice. Fast forward several days to
this morning and I need to go out to run some errands. Just before I
leave I notice the Software Update icon in the dock and realize that
this would be a good time to let the update run since I wont be at my
desk for an hour or so anyway. When I get back there's bad news on the
screen. The update file was corrupted and so it won't be able to
complete the install. I let it reboot expecting (with fingers crossed!)
that it will boot back into the non-updated OS X. Nope. The boot hangs
and eventually the machine shuts itself off. So then I boot up from an
external drive and jump into the Disk Utility app and select the
internal hard drive and get more bad news, something like "The file
system is corrupted and can not be repaired by this utility. Copy your
important data and reinitialize the hard drive as soon as possible."
Despair! Anguish! Then my eyes fall on the other external hard drive on
my desk, and a smile begins to curl the corners of my mouth and the
twinkle returns to my eyes. [Time
Machine](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/timemachine.html) to the
rescue! I plug in the time machine disk and check when the last backup
was run and find it was only about 40 minutes before the failure. YAY!

So after copying the few things from the internal drive that I know that
time machine wasn't backing up (because I told it not to) and then
erasing and reformatting the drive, I booted from the Leopard DVD and
told it to restore from my time machine backup. And it has been doing
exactly that as I've been writing this post from another machine, all
140GB worth of data, music, projects, source code, tools, applications,
and everything else chugging along from the time machine back into the
Mac. If you've ever had disk failures before and no recent or adequate
backups then this is truly a beautiful sight.

Thanks Apple, your Time Machine has just saved my bacon!

The question remains however, do I dare attempt to do the update again?
