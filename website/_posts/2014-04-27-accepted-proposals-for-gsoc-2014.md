We are very happy to announce that six students have been accepted to work on
wxWidgets during this year [Google Summer of Code][1]. This is the most
projects we have ever had, but unfortunately we still had to reject several
other good proposals. We hope to see the students who couldn't be accepted
this year during the next year GSoC.

In the meanwhile, congratulations to the students chosen this year and we hope
to see a lot of great changes in wxWidgets at the end of the summer. The most
exciting project this year is probably the new wxAndroid port, but there are
also projects to add support for Direct2D and DirectText, integrate Chromium
backend in wxWebView, improve the state of wxUniv port, add support for the
Windows taskbar features such as jump lists and even wxQt port.

We are looking forward to all of them and good luck to our students and big
thanks to their mentors!
