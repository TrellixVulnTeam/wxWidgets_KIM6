wxWidgets 2.9.2 has been officially released. It is available from the usual
locations at [SourceForge][1] and [FTP mirror][2]. Please read the
[change log][3] if you're upgrading from a previous version. And please see
online documentation for more details.

The 2.9 series bring many improvements compared to 2.8 series such as much
better Unicode support and the new wxOSX/Cocoa port as well as a huge number of
other new features and bug fixes. While this is still officially a development
release because some API details are still not frozen, we believe that 2.9.2
can be used in production environment, especially for the new projects for
which (small) changes in behaviour since 2.8 are not a problem. Give it a try
and let us know what do you think!
