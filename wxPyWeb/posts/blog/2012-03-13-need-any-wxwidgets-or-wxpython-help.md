My current long-term consulting project will be coming to an end soon,
so I am currently looking for some short-term paying projects to fill in
while I'm looking for my next long-term gig. Â Anything ranging from a
few days to several weeks worth of work would be fine. So if you would
like some help with your wx-related projects, would like to have
specific bugs fixed or new features added to
[wxWidgets](http://wxWidgets.org) or [wxPython](http://wxPython.org), or
would like to sponsor some of my work on
[Phoenix](http://wiki.wxpython.org/ProjectPhoenix), then please send me
an email and we can discuss the details.

Of course if you have or know of a long-term position available that
would fit my skill set then please let me know about that as well.

Thanks!
