How to Uninstall wxPython Classic
=================================

In the past wxPython provided a script to mostly automate the removal of
installed versions of wxPython, however newer versions of OSX and also the
installer package format have changed things enough that the old uninstall
script no longer works. This document describes how to manually remove the
files installed by the wxPython installer, if there is ever a need to do so.


WARNING!!  WARNING!!  WARNING!!  WARNING!!  WARNING!!  WARNING!!

Be VERY careful when removing files and folders, especially when the
names are coming from a tool like pkgutil or lsbom. Carefully examine
the names in a dry-run before doing the actual removal. If you are
not careful you may blow away something important, like I did while
testing the previous version of these instructions!  (Thankfully, Time
Machine saved the day once again!)


Using pkgutil
-------------

Apple's pkgutil command can be used to assist with the uninstallation.  The
first thing that needs to be done is to locate the package name::

    $ pkgutil --pkgs

Look for a package name containing "wxpython", like "org.wxpython.classic".
If there isn't one then try following the instructions in the next section.

This command will give you a list of all the files and folders that were
installed by the installer::

    $ pkgutil --files org.wxpython.classic

Review this list very, very carefully. If you are satisfied that none of those
files would cause problems if they are removed then you can manually remove
the listed files.  There are a ton of them however, so if you would like to
automate it you can remove them all like this, where VERSION is set to the
version number of wxPython you are wanting to remove::

    $ cd /
    $ pkgutil --only-files --files org.wxpython.classic | xargs sudo rm
    $ sudo rm -r usr/local/lib/wxPython-$VERSION


The final step is to cause OSX to forget about the old installation using this
command::

    $ sudo pkgutil --forget org.wxpython.classic



Older installations
-------------------

Look in `/Library/Receipts` for a `*.pkg` folder for wxPython, such as
`/LibraryReceipts/wxPython3.0-osx-cocoa-py2.7.pkg`.  Let's call this folder
$PKGBASE.  Similar to the above, you can get a listing of files that were
installed by that installer using commands like this::

    $ lsbom -s $PKGBASE/Contents/Resources/*.bom

And those files and folders can be removed like the following. Please review
the full list before trying this, to ensure that you are not going to removed
anything important.::

    $ cd /
    $ lsbom -sf $BASE/Contents/Resources/*.bom | xargs sudo rm
    $ sudo rm -r usr/local/lib/wxPython-$VERSION

And the final step in this case is to remove the pkg folder from
`/Library/Receipts`, like this::

    $ sudo rm -r $PKGBASE


Fully manual uninstall
----------------------

If the above are not working for you then you can manually remove the
installed files and folders.  The majority of the files are in this location,
go ahead and remove this folder, (substituting the appropriate VERSION
number)::

    /usr/local/lib/wxPython-$VERSION

In the same place there is likely a "wxPython" symbolic link pointing to the
folder you just removed.  You can either remove the link, or set it to point
to a different versioned wxPython folder that may already be in
/usr/local/lib.

The next thing to clean up are the tool launchers in /usr/local/bin::

    /usr/local/bin/editra
    /usr/local/bin/editra.py
    /usr/local/bin/genaxmodule
    /usr/local/bin/helpviewer
    /usr/local/bin/helpviewer.py
    /usr/local/bin/img2png
    /usr/local/bin/img2py
    /usr/local/bin/img2xpm
    /usr/local/bin/pyalacarte
    /usr/local/bin/pyalacarte.py
    /usr/local/bin/pyalamode
    /usr/local/bin/pyalamode.py
    /usr/local/bin/pycrust
    /usr/local/bin/pycrust.py
    /usr/local/bin/pyshell
    /usr/local/bin/pyshell.py
    /usr/local/bin/pyslices
    /usr/local/bin/pyslices.py
    /usr/local/bin/pysliceshell
    /usr/local/bin/pysliceshell.py
    /usr/local/bin/pywrap
    /usr/local/bin/pywrap.py
    /usr/local/bin/pywxrc
    /usr/local/bin/xrced
    /usr/local/bin/xrced.py

Finally, there is a .pth file created by the installers that help multiple
pythons find the wxPython installation that was just removed.  These files are
named `wxredirect.pth` and will be located under the following locations::

    /Library/Python
    /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions

Search for wxredirect.pth in these locations and remove the ones that match
the version Python you are removing wxPython from.
