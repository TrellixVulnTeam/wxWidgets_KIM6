Kirix is pleased to announce the availability of wxWebConnect 1.1 - a new
version of a library that enables developers to quickly integrate advanced web
browser capabilities. It wraps up functionality exposed by the Mozilla
Foundation's Gecko engine (XULRunner) into a set of user-friendly classes. The
new version includes support for XULRunner 1.9.2, better profile support, and
many bug fixes. More information can be found at the [wxWebConnect][1] project
