title: "Credits"
---

There are hundreds of people who have made wxWidgets possible through donated
hardware, services, development, documentation, translations, and support. We
couldn't possibly list them all here over the last twenty years, however, we
would like to highlight just a few of those rockstars.

## Equipment and Financial Donations

[VMware, Inc.][1] has supplied free VMware licences to members of the wxWidgets
development team. VMware is a superb solution for people who need to access
more than one operating system simultaneously. A big thank you to VMware for
supporting the project.

Thank you to [Microsoft][3] for donating a copy of Visual C++ 6.0 to help
wxWidgets compile on this version of the compiler (for a Virginia Tech course).

Michael Bedward has made a donation to support the wxWidgets 2 for Motif port.

Shiv Shankar Ramakrishnan, a Microsoft employee with wxWidgets development
experience, has very generously donated a massive amount of Microsoft software
to core wxWidgets developers, which has allowed us to test wxWidgets against
VC++ 7 and generally get us up-to-date with operating systems and other
packages in 2003. Many many thanks to Shiv! Some of us would still be in the
dark ages without this donation.

Rob Chandler has donated a license for [H2Reg][4], a program for integrating MS
HTML Help into the Visual Studio .NET help system for our use in 2003.

## Hosting

Bryan Petty provides hosting for this website, the online user manuals, and the
wxWiki.

We are grateful to Chris Elliott at York University for hosting our main FTP
site which serves as a mirror of all main releases as well as the primary
source of all daily builds.

Robin Dunn has graciously provided hosting of the central Subversion (SVN)
repository and issue tracker.

Thanks to Yiorgos Adamopoulos, Cord Hockemeyer, Johan Hofvander, and Jobst
Schmalenbach for maintaining mirror sites.

Mike Lorenz of [VisionX][6] set up our original domain name, www.wxwindows.org.

## Developers

We would particularly like to thank the following for their contributions to
wxWidgets, and the many others who have been involved in the project over the
years. Apologies for any unintentional omissions from this list.

Main Authors:

* wxWidgets 2 for GTK+: Robert Roebling - Latin scholar, medic, Renaissance man
* wxWidgets 2 for Windows: Julian Smart - Multum in Parvo in Rutland
* wxWidgets 2 for Motif: Julian Smart - didn't quite mean to do that port too,
  oh well
* wxWidgets 2 for Mac: Stefan Csomor - keeping baby/keyboard separation optimal
* wxWidgets 1 for Xt: Markus Holzem - keeping his sanity now he's away
* wxString, wxConfig, Windows drag and drop, and loads of other great stuff
  without which we would be quite stuck: the one and only Vadim Zeitlin,
  physicist and wxWidgets hero
* wxThread, wxSocket and multimedia classes: the deceptively young but talented
  Guilhem Lavaux
* wxHTML: the highly dedicated Vaclav Slavik
