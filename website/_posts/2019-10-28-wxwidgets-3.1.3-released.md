wxWidgets 3.1.3 release is now
[available on GitHub](https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/releases/tag/v3.1.3).
You will find there archives with the library sources and documentation as
well as binaries for the selected Windows compilers such as [Microsoft Visual
C++](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) and [MinGW-w64](https://mingw-w64.org/).

Please notice that while 3.1.3 is officially a "development" version because
it is not fully compatible with the "stable" 3.0.x, the list of backwards
incompatible changes is very short, so you shouldn't have any problems
updating to this version from 3.0.x in practice, and you're encouraged to use
this release, including in production.

### Changes in this release

There have been almost 2000 commits from 97 unique contributors (52 with
multiple contributions) since 3.1.2 releases, so it is impossible to summarize
all the changes in this document without making it too long, please see the
[full changelog](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/v3.1.3/docs/changes.txt)
for more details, but some of the most important changes are:

- Support for per-monitor DPI and dynamic DPI changes under MSW.
- More generally, many fixes for various controls appearance in high DPI.
- Long requested support for freezing rows and/or columns in wxGrid.
- New XRC handlers for wxDataViewCtrl, wxInfoBar.
- It is now possible to use gradients when creating wxGraphicsPen.
- Extended compiler (MSVS 2019) and platforms (macOS 10.14+) support.
