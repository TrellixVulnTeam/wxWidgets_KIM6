The wxPython mail lists are hosted on Google Groups, so they can be used in
the traditional way via sending and receiving emails, or they can be used
on-line at the Google Groups site. This provides an experience very much
like on-line forums, which many people prefer.

The wxPython mail lists are an excellent resource for anyone who is using
wxPython, especially newbies who are just learning wxPython. Nearly anyone
on the 
[wxPython-users](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/wxpython-users) 
list will tell you that it is one of the best and friendliest that
they have ever seen, and a great source of help. Not only while they were
first learning wxPython, but also when they tackled some of the more
complex subjects.

Each and every one of the list subscribers contribute to that excellence
and friendliness. You are encouraged to stay involved with the mail list.
Don't just ask your question and then fade away. If you are helped then
please try to pass it on someday when somebody asks a question that you
know the answer to. The more you help then the more you learn yourself.
Please keep the tone and language used in your messages friendly, helpful
and professional. If your granny would smack you for saying something that
is rude or insensitive then don't send it to our mail lists. If you don't
have much experience with mail lists in the past then you may want to read
one of the many [etiquette](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=mail+list+etiquette)
documents out there to help you get acquainted with good behavior.

Please note that you must be subscribed to the list to be able to send mail
messages to it. This is done to help reduce the amount of spam messages
going through the lists. Any subscriber found to be posting spam messages
to the list will be reported and banned from the list.

When reporting problems or asking for help on any of the maillist/groups be
sure to give all the relevant details of your environment (platform, Python
version, wxPython version) and also include a small, runnable [sample
application](https://wiki.wxpython.org/MakingSampleApps) which demonstrates
your issue.  If you don't then it is very likely that the only response you
will get is a request to do so.


## The Maillists/Groups

**wxPython-users**
:    The main list for discussing wxPython, getting questions answered, sharing 
	 experiences, etc. All questions that are Python specific should be asked here.<br>
     [Mail Address](mailto:wxpython-users@googlegroups.com),
     [Group URL](http://groups.google.com/group/wxpython-users)
<br>
**wxPython-dev**
:    This list is for coordinating between people who working on or contribute 
	 code or documentation to wxPython, discussions about future directions, details 
	 of issues and problems, etc.<br>
     [Mail Address](mailto:wxpython-dev@googlegroups.com),
     [Group URL](http://groups.google.com/group/wxpython-dev)
<br>
**wx-users**
:    Since many of the questions and issues encountered in wxPython
     actually have nothing to do with Python or the wxPython extension
     module, this list is a good one to subscribe to as well. This list is
     for discussing general wxWidgets issues and the majority of messages
     apply to wxPython as well.  <br>
     [Mail Address](mailto:wx-users@googlegroups.com),
     [Group URL](http://groups.google.com/group/wx-users)
<br>
**wx-dev**
:    For discussion of development issues for wxWidgets. Common topics are which 
     new features should be added, bugs needing fixed, build issues,<br>
     [Mail Address](mailto:wx-dev@googlegroups.com),
     [Group URL](http://groups.google.com/group/wx-dev)
