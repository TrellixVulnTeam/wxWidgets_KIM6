The first official release of the new version of wxPython (code name Phoenix)
has just been released to [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/wxPython/4.0.0a1).

This release brings support for Python 3 (while still supporting Python 2.7),
installation from PyPI and is fully self-contained and relocatable so it can
be installed in virtual environments.

See [migration guide](https://wxpython.org/Phoenix/docs/html/MigrationGuide.html)
if you're upgrading from a previous wxPython version and [full API
documentation](https://wxpython.org/Phoenix/docs/html/main.html) for the new
version.
