wxWidgets 3.0.2 maintenance release is now [available][1]. Upgrading to it is
strongly recommended for all users of the previous 3.0.x release as it bring a
lot of bug fixes but remains 100% compatible with 3.0.0, both at the API and
the ABI level, and so upgrading to it doesn't require absolutely any changes
to the existing applications.

In addition to the fixes, described in more details in the [change log][6],
this release also includes a few minor new features, notably a couple of
additions to XRC.

As usual, please download the [sources][1] or [binaries][2] if you are using
one of the supported Windows compilers (Microsoft Visual C++ or [MinGW-TDM][3])
from SourceForge or our [FTP mirror][4]. The documentation can be downloaded
for the offline use from the same locations or [consulted online][5].

Thanks to everybody who contributed, by reporting bugs and submitting patches,
to this wxWidgets release. We hope you will find it even better than the
previous one and will enjoy using it!
