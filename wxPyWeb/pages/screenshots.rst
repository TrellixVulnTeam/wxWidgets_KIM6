`Vintech RCAM-Pro <http://www.vintech.bg/>`_ is a CAM system, specially
designed for true shape nesting and programming of CNC machines for thermal
and jet cutting of sheet parts. The system has been developed for more than
20 years. It has accumulated technological experience from partnerships
with manufacturers and users of wide range of CNC machines for thermal and
other cutting types.

`GNUmed <http://wiki.gnumed.de/bin/view/Gnumed>`_ is a Free/Libre
electronic medical record (EMR) for Unix-like systems (BSD, Linux, and UNIX
systems), Microsoft Windows, macOS and other platforms. GNUmed aims to
provide medical software that respects the privacy of patients and that is
based on open standards.

GNUmed is based on third party projects such as free software/open source
DBMS PostgreSQL and is written mostly in Python. It is supported by a
graphical user interface (GUI) based on wxPython.



Robot Framework IDE (RIDE)
--------------------------

    .. thumbnail:: /screenshots/RIDE_on_Linux_test_runner.png 


`RIDE <https://github.com/robotframework/RIDE>`_ is is a test data 
editor for `Robot Framework <http://robotframework.org/>`_ test data. 
Navigate through your Test Suites folders, and run them
filtering by Tags. Edit Test Cases in the Cell Editor with context help and
code highlighting, or use the Text Editor for space formatted files. Select
the language binding to run Robot Framework, like Jython or Python, and
then open on your browser the Log or Report files with a click. It runs on
Linux, Mac and Windows.



OutWiker - the tree notes organizer
-----------------------------------

    .. thumbnail:: /screenshots/outwiker_2.0.0_02_en.png
    .. thumbnail:: /screenshots/outwiker_2.0.0_05_en.png


`OutWiker <http://jenyay.net/Outwiker/English>`_ is designed to store
notes in a tree. Such programs are called "outliner", personal wiki, or
tree-like editors. OutWiker's main difference from the other similar
programs is keeping the tree of notes in the form of directories on disk,
and encouraging changing the base by external sources and programs.

Also any number of files can be attached to the page. OutWiker can contain
pages of different types, currently supports three types of pages: plain
text, HTML pages and wiki pages, but the number of types of pages will
increase in future.


BetaMatch
---------

`BetaMatch <http://www.mnw-scan.com/>`_ is a very specialized software system for
component matching of antennas. A demo version can be downloaded from the site if 
anybody is interested in playing around.


DisplayCAL

    .. thumbnail:: /screenshots/DisplayCAL-screenshot-GNOME-view-curves.png



`DisplayCAL <https://displaycal.net/>`_ is a display calibration and
profiling solution with a focus on accuracy and versatility. At its core it
relies on ArgyllCMS, an open source color management system, to take
measurements, create calibrations and profiles, and for a variety of other
advanced color related tasks.

`Pyspread <https://manns.github.io/pyspread/>`_ is a non-traditional
spreadsheet application that is based on and written in the programming
language Python. The goal of pyspread is to be the most pythonic
spreadsheet. Pyspread expects Python expressions in its grid cells, which
makes a spreadsheet specific language obsolete. Each cell returns a Python
object that can be accessed from other cells. These objects can represent
anything including lists or matrices.

`Larch <http://xraypy.github.io/xraylarch/>`_ is an open-source library and
toolkit for processing and analyzing scientific data. Initially designed
for X-ray spectroscopic and scattering data collected at modern synchrotron
sources, Larch provides a wide selection of algorithms for processing such
X-ray data. It also provides many tools for organizing complex data sets
and processing and analyzing arrays of scientific data.
