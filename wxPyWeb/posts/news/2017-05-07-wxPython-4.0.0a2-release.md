**wxPython 4.0.0a2** is now available at 
[PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/wxPython/4.0.0a2) 

This build of wxPython is based on the official wxWidgets 3.0.3 release.

This release is mostly various bug fixes and other tweaks, such as: <!-- TEASER_END -->

  * Allow numpy arrays to be auto-converted to simple sequence value types
    like wx.Size, wx.Colour, etc.

  * A couple of fixes to lib/agw/aui to prevent segfaults under OSX when
    AuiNotebook tabs are closed

  * Fix wx.\_core.wxAssertionError in wx.lib.agw.aui when dragging a notebook tab

  * Fix the [G|S]etClientData methods in wx.CommandEvent to behave the same
    way they are in wx.ClientDataContainer.

  * Fix the SetFonts methods in wx.html classes

  * Several fixes in wx.dataview related to overriding methods

  * Fixed some flickering in wx.lib.agw.aui.framemanager

  * Fixed problem with wrong implementation of wxNotebook::DeleteAllPages being
    called on Windows

  * Added the missing wx.grid.GRID_AUTOSIZE flag

  * Fixed crash due to the object created in an XmlSubclassFactory being
    destroyed too soon

  * Fixed crash in wx.lib.agw.toasterbox

  * Fixed crash when using wx.xrc.XmlSubclassFactory

  * Fixed wx.grid.GridTableBase.GetValue and related methods to work more like
    they did in Classic, so non-string values can be used a little more
    easily.

Added building and bundling of the PDB files for wxWidgets and the wxPython
extensions on Windows.  Until a better place is found they will be
downloadable from [https://wxPython.org/Phoenix/release-extras](https://wxPython.org/Phoenix/release-extras), along with
archives for the documentation as well as the demo and samples.
