wxWidgets has been allocated two slots for this year [Google Summer of
Code][1]. Congratulations to Prashant Kumar and Jose Lorenzo for being
selected to work on them! This year projects are: adding support for
multi-touch gestures to wxWidgets (Prashant) and improving integration with
JavaScript in wxWebView (Jose). Good luck to our students and looking forward
to seeing the result of their work in wxWidgets!

Thanks to everyone who has applied to wxWidgets organization this year, to our
mentors and, of course, to Google for organizing GSoC.
